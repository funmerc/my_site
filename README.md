# Personal Website (my_site)
This is an informative personal site used for practicing, showcasing skills, and personal references.

## Main Page
The main page is served up by a [Node.js Server](https://github.com/funmerc/my_site/tree/main/server) and is a [Vue.js SPA](https://github.com/funmerc/my_site/tree/main/vue-landing-app). This employs numerous techniques in order to display skills learned while using the Vue framework. The main content contained in this page includes information pertaining to my resume, and information about myself.

- Uses bootstrap to make a seamless experience between web and mobile.
- Uses transitions for a smooth feel moving to different sections.
- Makes use of the vuex store and calls to the server to fetch the data displayed from data files (I may switch this to a db in the future).
- Uses vue routing for traversing, displaying, and routing to the different subsections.
