  "why": "I grew up around computers and watched them evolve to what they are now, at an early age I was helping my dad take apart computers, using the parts, and building new ones. It was not until I started going to college that I realized I wanted to get into software though. The true beauty of software in my opinion is the pure freedom of creation with little cost, only your effort."
